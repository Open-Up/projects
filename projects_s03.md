# List projects

## 1: Improve James admin server

James stands for Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server. It is a project from the Apache Foundation, and Linagora is it's main contributor.

James can be configured by the command line. But as we want James to be integrated with other services, we want to be able to configure it remotly, through a REST interface. We introduced such a REST interface. Your goal is to improve it.

You will add the following capabilities : 

 - CRD on domain mappings : *@domain.com become *@newDomain.com
 - CRD Address mappings : address@domain.com become newAddress@newDomain.com

Later you can also : 

 - Set and Reset mail quotas (global quota, per user quota, quota for message count, and for size)
 - Set and Reset Sieve quotas (per user quotas, and global quota)

The following code, if good quality, will be contributed to the Apache foundation. You will have reviews from engineer from Liangora.
